# Aspen IP21 Big data extraction
VBA Useform for Big data extraction using Aspen IP21 functions.

When it is tried to use the data extraction through Aspen IP21 
in excel, it happens that the time out is exceeded. But also this
system does not say the tags associated with each column of numbers. 
Then a possible solution when it is wanted to extract 10 years of 
operational data from a thermal power station can be to make multiple 
extractions and order their results according to each tag.
